Spoon-related utilities for Hammerspoon

The `spoon` command allows you to perform some common operations related to [Hammerspoon Spoons](http://www.hammerspoon.org/Spoons/index.html).

**This is early work in progress, feedback is appreciated**

To use this:
- Install [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/).
- Install my [SpoonUtils](https://github.com/zzamboni/Spoons/blob/SpoonUtils/Spoons/SpoonUtils.spoon.zip) spoon (this is not yet part of the official Spoon repository).
- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/zzamboni/spoon.git`
- Set up your path:
```
cd spoon
./bin/spoon init
# And follow the instructions
```

For now only the `list` and `new` commands are available. Type `spoon help <command>` to get some information.

Enjoy!
